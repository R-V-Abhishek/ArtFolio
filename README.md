# ArtFolio ðŸŽ¨

*The professional network for creatives. Showcase your projects and build your story.*

## About The Project

ArtFolio is an Android mobile application designed for artists, designers, musicians, and all creative professionals. It bridges the gap between a visual-first platform like Instagram and a corporate network like LinkedIn. 

The core problem ArtFolio solves is that creatives need a way to present a curated, professional narrative of their work that is more organized than a social media feed but easier to maintain than a personal website.

## Core Features

* **Project-Centric Profiles:** Build a portfolio based on rich, multi-image "Project Stories," not a fleeting chronological feed.
* **Curated Instagram Sync:** Select specific posts from your Instagram to import and narrate the story behind your work.
* **Collaborator Tagging:** Tag other artists on projects to build a verifiable network of your creative collaborations.
* **Skills & Discovery:** Tag your projects with skills (e.g., #OilPainting, #Blender) and discover other creatives through a skill-based feed.
* **Location Tagging:** Add a physical location to your projects, perfect for murals, installations, and landscape work.

## Tech Stack

* **Platform:** Android (Flutter)
* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
* **APIs:** Instagram Basic Display API, Google Maps SDK
