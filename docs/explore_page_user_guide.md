## 🎨 Trending Score Explained

### What Makes Content Trending?

**Formula:**
```
Trending Score = Engagement × Recency

Engagement = (Likes × 1) + (Comments × 3) + (Shares × 5) + (Kudos × 4) + (Views × 0.1)

Recency Factor:
- Recent posts: Higher multiplier
- 1 day old: 0.96x
- 3 days old: 0.75x
- 7 days old: 0.50x
- Older: 0.10x
```

### Why Different Weights?
- **Shares (5 pts)**: Highest value - people recommend it
- **Kudos (4 pts)**: Professional recognition
- **Comments (3 pts)**: High engagement, discussion
- **Likes (1 pt)**: Basic appreciation
- **Views (0.1 pt)**: Awareness, low barrier
