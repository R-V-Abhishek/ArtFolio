# Assets

This directory contains static design & media assets.

## Structure
- `images/` - bitmap or raster images (PNG/JPEG/WebP)
- `icons/`  - vector icons & branded marks (SVG)

## Placeholders
- `images/placeholder.png` is an empty file used to keep the folder tracked.
- `icons/logo.svg` is a temporary draft logo for development only.

Replace these with production-ready assets before release.
